# JLCPCB Manufacturing Capabilities — Reference Copy

*Captured from jlcpcb.com by me, 2026-08-02. Quick-sheet corrected to the 4-layer Rev A board 2026-08-21 (the capability tables below remain the original 2026-08-02 site capture). Like stock and Basic/Extended status, capabilities are **live values** — re-skim the site before each order.

## What this means for Rev A

My board (**4-layer** JLC04161H-7628, 1.6 mm, green, JLC assembly) against JLC's limits — everything fits, with margin:

| Mine (Rev A) | JLC limit | Margin |
|---|---|---|
| Track/clearance 0.2 / 0.2 mm | 0.09 / 0.09 (multilayer, 1 oz) | >2× |
| Routing via 0.6 / 0.3 | 0.25 / 0.15 min | comfortable — and **no surcharge** (extra cost only for 0.15 holes, or 0.2/0.25 holes with pad < 0.45) |
| ESP32 module thermal vias 0.6 / 0.2 | see above | **no surcharge** — hole 0.2 but pad 0.6 ≥ 0.45 ✓ |
| Copper-to-edge 0.5 | ≥ 0.2 (routed) | 2.5× |
| Pad hole-to-hole (KiCad set 0.5) | 0.45 pad holes / 0.2 via holes | ✓ |
| PTH hole to track — KiCad "copper to hole" **set 0.3** | 0.28 min / 0.35 recommended | ⚠ was 0.25 → bumped to 0.3 (2026-08-02) |
| NPTH holes: USB-C pegs Ø0.65, mounting Ø3.2 | ≥ 0.5 | ✓ |
| Silkscreen 1.0 mm text / 0.15 line | 1.0 / 0.15 minimum | at the floor — don't go smaller |
| Silk near pads | clipped within 0.15 of a pad | expect clipping, not an error |
| 0603 passives, 0.65 mm LGA, 1.27 mm module | Economic: 0402 / 0.4 mm pitch min | ✓ all parts qualify dimensionally |
| All parts top side | Economic = single-sided placement | ✓ |
| 4 L / 1.6 mm / green | Economic PCBA row exists (HASL or ENIG, qty 2–50) — but **confirmed at the 2026-08-21 order: U3 (module) AND U4 (BME280) are Standard-only parts**, so Rev A assembles as Standard PCBA | ✓ |

Notes for ordering day: **reflow is 255 ± 5 °C and not adjustable** on Economic (all my parts are fine with that; the battery is never assembled). The ESP32-S3 module (C2913198) is a **Standard-tier part** per PROJECT_STATUS — expect the Standard assembly flow/pricing for that line. Board size: Economic's 10×10 – 470×500 mm covers me trivially, but **Standard PCBA's minimum single board is 70×70 mm** (live site, 2026-08-21) — the 62.5×44.5 board rides in a JLC-added panel with rails and fiducials, which is exactly what the ORDER_NOTES rail-placement remark is for. No stencil purchase needed when JLC does the assembly — the stencil section below matters only if I ever hand-paste at home.
